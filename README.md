# Platform-Game-2d

this is mmy first game project ever, so maybe is buggy.
It was created using Unity and C#.
the initial idea was to really get our hands dirty and create a project.
it's still extremely simple, but it's better than nothing.
The initial problem was creating the scripts to move the saws in a natural way, then I used the same script for the spiked ball
but the chains and the ball were not moving the same, so I had to change the speed and use the chains.
